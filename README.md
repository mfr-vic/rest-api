# REST API :

This project was made with the intent to better understand and put in practice some concepts of CRUD and REST API.

## Dependencies :
[Express](https://expressjs.com/) = used to create different routes;
[Uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) = Autogenerates completely different ID's;
[Postman](https://www.postman.com/product/what-is-postman/) = used to make different requests to the API, so endpoints would be tested;
[Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) = package that automatically save changes so the server won't need to be manually opened/closed every time something is added.

## Installation :

In your terminal, use the following commands:

```bash
 npm install express --save
```
```bash
 npm install uuid
```
```bash
 npm install --save-dev nodemon
